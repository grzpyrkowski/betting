# Betting

2nd oldest application, currently most advanced one. No longer updated. \
Project created for personal (within friends) use to bet past Euro 2024 cup. \
Project was done in MERN stack with several additions - Tailwind CSS, Mongoose, Kinde for authentication, Render as a web service and Chart.js for displaying results.

## Start the app

Application is avaliable [here](https://betting-euro2024.onrender.com/). Site may take a while to display, because of non-paid instance in Render. \
Highly recommend to see the app by the link attached above - starting application localy will result in missing data, because remote repository doesn't contain MongoDB connection files. \
Nevertheless here you have 2-step guide how to run the app localy:

### 1. Install dependencies
   by typing \
   **npm install** \
   separately in both (client and server) directories.
   
### 2. Run the app
   running commands \
   **npm start** \
   being in /client dir and \
   **node index.js** \
   being in /server dir, respectively.
